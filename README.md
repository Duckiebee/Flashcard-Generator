# Flashcard-Generator

This application implements a basic flash card game where the user is prompted with a question and then shown the correct answer. The right and wrong answers are tallied up and the total is displayed at the end of the game.

 The flash cards are constructed with the `ClozeCard` constructor defined in flashCards.js The questions.js file is not included. The repo only contains the code for the functionality of the flashcard.
